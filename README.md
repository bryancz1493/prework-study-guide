# Webpage for Pre-work Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This Pre-work Study Guide was created as a guidance for boot camp students while going through the pre-work assignment. It helps me to understand the materials better as I am summarizing things I learned in four different categories: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

For this study guide, I can use it as my notes to review things I learned in the pre-work assignment. It basically summarizes everything as my notes while learning in sections by bullet points. It looks clean and organized while reviewing. I learn how to open the Chrome DevTools console by press Command+Option+I and the console panel can be found at the side of the webpage. For now, I think I will start studying with JavaScript because I want to be efficient in Java with same outcome by having shorter codes. I remember using arrays and if else statement in C++, and it is really fun to play around with when you are familiar with the language.
